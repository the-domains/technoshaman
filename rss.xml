            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cuba on the Edge of Change</h1><p>at times can feel like a nation abandoned. The aching disrepair of its cities, the untamed foliage of its countryside, the orphaned coastlines - a half-century of isolation has wrapped the country in decay. Yet few places in the world brim with as much life as Cuba, a contrast drawn sharper amid its faded grandeur.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/fadd80fef63f3704329bd8f3effa0b99/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=548&cropwidth=1050&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F196de034f71ac2612a2898c9ace08482d0e1afa6.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Behind The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book's Brand New Update</h1><p>There are few cocktail guides with as much history as "The Old-Waldorf Astoria Bar Book" by Albert Stevens Crockett. The original source material, "Old Waldorf Bar Days" (1931), also by Crockett, was penned during Prohibition but the author rewrote it as we know it in 1933 when Prohibition ended.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c1d32105a54d9d89e483ba0384354f52d2dcf9ef.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Assignment of a Lifetime: Riding in a U-2 Spy Plane at the Edge of Space</h1><p>Back in 2010, San Francisco-based photographer Christopher Michel received a once-in-a-lifetime photo assignment from the US Navel Institute: to ride in the back seat of a U-2 spy plane at the "edge of space." At the plane's cruising and intelligence-gathering altitude of 70,000 feet above the ground, temperatures outside the plane fall to 70 degrees below zero.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04f6c0633f5a485f90dde99e96cd653a67f86bd6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
